# SurveyFeed

web Address: https://survey-feed.herokuapp.com

SurveyFeed helps sellers reach out to their (1 to thousands ) of clients to ask for service satisfaction. Sellers can create surveys, surveys are sent to clients through email services. Then the application dynamically manages and keeps track of the responses provided by the clients and presents it to the Sellers.

For instance, a seller can simply ask a 1000 clients, "Did our service meet your needs and expectations?", now according to the clientsâ€™ responses, the app will calculate the number of satisfactions and dissatisfactions. The app is not limited to sellers only, anyone who seeks feedback from a collection of people can benefit from our application.

Designed and implemented server side and client side, with both development and production environment using JavaScript ES6, Node.js, Express.js, React, Redux (Thunk, Form), HTML5/CSS3, Bootstrap, Reactstrap, MongoDB. The app provides secure Google OAuth 2.0 Authentication, and Stripe Credit Card Payment services.

The Application is currently under development and I look further to add new great functionalities.

Note: When you open the website for the first time, it will take couple seconds to restart the App on the hosted server. Additionaly, feel secure to login since I use Google as a third party Authentication services. I will only have access to your full name and profile picture. To add credits to your account, I use Stripe as a third-party payment service, as of now you can simply add fake data into the credit card form, except the Card Number should be 4242 4242 4242 4242
