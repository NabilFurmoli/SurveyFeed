Our mission is to connect Sellers to their Clients, SurveyFeed helps sellers reach out to their thousands of clients to ask for service satisfaction. Sellers can create surveys, surveys are sent to clients through email services. Then the application dynamically manages and keeps track of the responses provided by the clients and presents it to the Sellers. 

For instance, a seller can simply ask a 1000 clients, "Did our service meet your needs and expectations?", now according to the clientsâ€™ responses, the app will calculate the number of satisfactions and dissatisfactions. The app is not limited to sellers only, anyone who seeks feedback from a collection of people can benefit from our application.

Our application is currently under development and we look further to add new great functionalities
